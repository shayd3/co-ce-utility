☐ Split PDF on selected line and create n number of PDF files in a zip and prompt download
☐ Utilize Format Name checkbox properly format the name of the PDF file based on a person's name
☐ Add input for state name or to provide a file with a suffix
☐ Get gh-page working with the vue project to properly deploy app

☐ Signature functionality working (hardcoded first so we can release this portion)
☐ Signature form so that it's also 1 button and can inject signature anywhere on the PDF


When it comes to the pdf file names themselves, look into doing the following:
☐ Instead of closing the dialog, have a 'next' button that will show you the full list of the file names.
☐ Have a checkbox that will allow you to add a prefix to each file name
☐ Have a checkbox that will allow you to add a suffix to each file name
☐ Have a checkbox that will allow you to modify line selected to be formatted in "last name, first name" format if a name is selected. This includes the names ending in Jr. Sr., I, II, III, IV, etc.
